# LLM Applications Repository

This repository hosts two distinct projects that leverage large language models (LLMs) in different domains: chess game prediction and generative imaging.

## Project 1: LLM for Chess Game Prediction

### Overview
This project focuses on developing an application that uses a large language model to predict the next move in a chess game. The model is trained to understand and analyze chess positions, offering insights into potential future moves based on the current state of the game.

### How It Works
- The LLM is trained on a dataset of generated chess games (by stockfish playing against himself).
- It analyzes the board's current state and predicts the most likely next move.
- This can be used to assist players in training or to enhance chess-related software.

### Objectives
- To train an LLM that can accurately predict chess moves.
- To integrate this model into a user-friendly chess training application.

## Project 2: Generative Imaging Using LLM

### Overview
The second project explores the capability of large language models to generate images based on textual descriptions. This application of LLMs demonstrates their potential beyond text processing, extending into creative visual arts.

### How It Works
- Users provide textual descriptions of images they wish to create.
- The LLM interprets these descriptions and generates corresponding images.

### Objectives
- To develop a tool that can create visual content from textual prompts.
- To explore and expand the boundaries of creative AI applications.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to both projects. If you're interested in improving the models, adding features, or fixing bugs, please feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
